WordImport Submission plugin
--------------------------------

This plugin for the assignment module allows Teachers to get HTML versions of 
any Word files uploaded by students for assignments, without relying on the 
unreliable Unoconv service.



==Thanks==
This plugin is derived from the assignsubmission_pdf plugin developed by Davo Smith.
